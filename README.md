# HTPC UI/UX Scripts

A collection of AutoHotKey scripts and Rainmeter Skins to improve Windows UI/UX

## Rainmeter

### TV Launcher

A rainmeter skin influenced by Windows tiles and smart TV displays. Utilizes AutoHotKey to launch apps into fullscreen mode and Python for generating copies of icons with transparent borders.

## AutoHotKey

### MaximizeWindowsApps

Maximize apps based on internal lists.

### PowerButtonHook

Intercept display off events to perform alternate actions, not perfect but good for remapping power button to AV receiver / TV power via a smart IR remote.

### RemapKeys

Simple example on how to intercept and remap keystrokes

### Drag to Scroll

Not included here or written by me, but very useful for air mouses
